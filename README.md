# -SMS-SPAM-CLASSIFIER-

### Spam is a universal problem with which everyone is familiar. A number of approaches are used for Spam filtering. The most common filtering technique is content-based filtering which uses the actual text of message to determine whether it is Spam or not. The content is very dynamic and it is very challenging to represent all information in a mathematical model of classification. For instance, in content-based Spam filtering, the characteristics used by the filter to identify Spam message are constantly changing over time. Na√Øve Bayes method represents the changing nature of message using probability theory and support vector machine (SVM) represents those using different features. These two methods of classification are efficient in different domains and the case of Nepali SMS or Text classification has not yet been in consideration; these two methods do not consider the issue and it is interesting to find out the performance of both the methods in the problem of Nepali Text classification.
